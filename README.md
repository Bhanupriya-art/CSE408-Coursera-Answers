## Week 1:- Max Subarray Problem

## Note:- We have to complete till Karatsuba's Multiplication Algorithm for week 5 according to our IP

### Q.1 Consider the array with numbers that is input to the max subarray problem<br> [1, 19, 5, -4, 7, 18, 15, -10 ]<br>Select all true facts from the list below making sure that no incorrect choices are selected.<br><br>Answer:-<br> 1. The output to the max subarray .problem should be 18-(-4) =22<br>2. The divide and conquer algorithm will compute the result of max subarray problem on the first half of the array, which in this instance yields the value 18<br>3. The divide and conquer algorithm will compute the result of max subarray problem on the second half of the array, which in this instance yields the value 11<br>4. The minimum element of the first half of the array is -4 and maximum element of the second half of the array is 18. These in turn form the result for the max subarray problem which is 22.

### Q.2 Consider the recurrence that represents the running time for the max subarray problem:<br>T(n) = &#123; &Theta;(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n &#8804; 2<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2T(n &frasl; 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise<br><br>Answer:-<br>1. The case when n &#8804; 2 represents the constant amount of work needed to find the max subarray for input arrays of size 1 or 2.<br>2. The recurrence assumes that n is a power of two, since repeated division by 2 can yield fractional results otherwise.<br>3. The &theta; (n) term in the recurrence for n> 2 represents the work to find minimum of first half and maximum of second half.<br>4. The recurrence and the running time are identical to that obtained for the mergesort algorithm covered earlier in course 1 of this specialization.

## Week 1:- Karatsuba's Multiplication Algorithm

### Q.1 The following questions concern the binary representation of numbers and addition. Note that we will write binary numbers as b<sub>n</sub>, ..., b<sub>0</sub> where b<sub>n</sub> is the most significant bit whereas b<sub>0</sub> is the least significant bit. However, represented as a list in the computer, the same number would be [b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, ... , b<sub>n</sub>].<br><br>Answer:- <br>1. The number 6 in decimal is represented by the list [0, 1, 1]<br>2. Consider two lists [0, 1, 1] and [1, 1]. The sum of these two numbers is given by [1, 0, 0, 1]<br>3. The addition of a m bit number with a n bit number yields a number with as many as max (m, n) + 1 bits.<br>4. The algorithm for adding two n bit numbers runs in time &theta; (n).

### Q.2 The following questions concern the grade school algorithm we studied in the lecture. Note that we will represent numbers as lists of bits. Select all the correct answers from the list below.<br><br>Answer:- <br>1. The grade school multiplication algorithms performs as many additions as the number of 1 bits in the second argument.<br>2. The shift operation performed at each step of the multiplication algorithm appends a 0 to the beginning of the list.<br>3. Consider the multiplication of two numbers represented by list a = [1, 0, 1] with b = [1, 1]. The grade school multiplication algorithm performs additions of the number [1, 0, 1,0] with the number [0, 1, 0, 11, yielding the result [1, 1, 1, 1]. Note the number a<sub>n</sub> ... a<sub>0</sub> is represented as a list [ a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub> ].

### Q.3 The following question concerns the multiplication of two n bit numbers a and b represented by the lists using the divide and conquer scheme presented in the lecture.<br>[ a<sub>0</sub>, ..., a<sub>n - 1</sub> ] and [ b<sub>0</sub>, ..., b<sub>n - 1</sub> ]<br>For any list of bits l, the number denoted by the list is denoted by [[l]]. Assume that n is a power of 2 and let m = n &frasl; 2.<br><br>Answer:- <br>1. The number denoted by the list [ a<sub>0</sub>, ..., a<sub>n - 1</sub> ] can be written as [[  [ a<sub>0</sub>, ..., a<sub>m - 1</sub> ] ]] + 2<sup>m</sup> [[  [ a<sub>m</sub>, ..., a<sub>n - 1</sub> ] ]]<br>2. Karatsuba multiplication of two n bit numbers makes three recursive calls with two of the calls involving multiplication of m bit numbers and one call involving multiplication of at most m + 1 bit number.<br>3. Depending on the implementation details and the computer on which we run, there is a cutoff value of n such that for all inputs with greater than in bits, the worst case running time of Karatsuba's algorithm will outperform the worst case running time of grade school multiplication.

## Week 1:- Master Method

### Q.1 Consider a recurrence of the form :<br> T(n) = &#123; &Theta;(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n  &#8804;  1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#123;3T(n/3) + &Theta;(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise<br>Select all the correct options from the list below.<br><br>Answer:-<br> 1) The recurrence above can be obtained from a divide and conquer scheme that divides inputs of size n into 3 subparts of size n/3 each.<br>2) Master method is applied with a = 6 = 3 and 1. Case-2 applies and the overall complexity is T(n) = &Theta;(n<sup>log<sub>3</sub></sup><sup>(3)</sup> log(n)) = &Theta;(nlog(n)).

### Q.2 Consider a recurrence of the form :<br> T(n) = &#123; &Theta;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n  &#8804;  1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#123;2T(n/3) + &Theta;(&#8730;n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise<br>Select all the correct options from the list below.<br><br>Answer:- <br>1) The recurrence denotes a divide and conquer scheme wherein the divide and combine steps take &Theta;(&#8730;n) time in total;<br>2) Master method is applied with a = 2 and b = 3. We have log<sub>b</sub>(a) = log<sub>3</sub>(2) which is a number between 0 and 1 but is greater than half.<br>3) Case-1 of the master method applies and the complexity of the algorithm is &Theta;(n<sup>log<sub>3<sub></sup><sup>(2)</sup>).
